# Short Description

The project explores relationship between students' online behavior and their success in an online course in a university.
According to research, early intervention has been effective in increasing student academic success. Data can be used to develop so-called "early warning" indicators that help identify students who may need extra attention to complete the course.  Instructors can use this information and figure out strategies to help those students progress to a passing grade.
In this project I looked at the data from an online course in a university with the goal of identifying students characteristics and behavior patterns that are linked to high risk of failing the class. The analysis can serve as a first step in developing "early warning" indicators that instructors and school administration can use to help student achieve their academic goals.
